# Bootstrap a Cronologia project

Load `sourcing-rules` first.

**If this project is a split out of an existing repo** — a subject that grew
inside another project rather than a new subject — do not bootstrap yet. Apply
the test in core `adr/0005-when-a-subject-becomes-its-own-repo.md` first: all
five dimensions must hold, the cheaper alternatives (disambiguation card,
`figures[]`/`organizations[]` entry, `branchTimeline` branch, cross-link) must
have been tried and found insufficient, and **the owner must have accepted the
split** — an agent suggests it in a ticket in the parent repo, with citations,
and never creates the repo on its own judgement. Reference that ADR (and the
accepted suggestion ticket) before step 1, and cite it in the new repo's first
ADR.

The proven sequence (used for fsspx and tl):

1. **Research.** Run parallel research on the subject: founding facts, a
   chronology of 25–40 key events with dates and places, key figures, related
   organizations (with disambiguations — what the subject is *not*), and 15–30
   public references with exact URLs. Verify primary-source URLs resolve.
   Mark everything the sources disagree on.
2. **Instantiate the template.** `tools/new-project.sh <dest> <accent colors>`
   — pick a distinct accent per subject (fsp red, fsspx blue, tl green).
3. **Write the data.** `data/chronology.json`: `meta`, `facts[]`, `events[]`,
   `figures[]`, `organizations[]`, `disambiguation.items[]`, `references[]`.
   Every entry cited; uncertain dates flagged. Then `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
   `context.md` (domain background, disambiguations, glossary pointers).
   Instead of re-explaining a shared term inline, cross-link the glossary with
   an inline `[[term-id]]` (or `[[term-id|visible text]]`) marker in any prose
   field — it renders as a link to `https://cronologia.github.io/glossary/<term-id>/`.
   The validator fails on unknown ids, checked against the vendored, pinned
   `data/glossary-terms.json`; run `node scripts/sync-glossary-terms.js` to
   refresh that list when the glossary adds terms (see `template/AGENTS.md`).
4. **Verify.** `node scripts/validate-data.js && node --test && node build.js`
   — commit `docs/` with the data. Screenshot the built page (headless
   chromium) and eyeball it.
5. **Publish.** Create the GitHub repo EMPTY; push `main` as the first branch;
   only then enable Pages (Source: GitHub Actions) — the github-pages
   environment pins its allowed branch to the default branch at enable time —
   and set the Actions variable `ENABLE_PAGES=true`. The workflow deploys on
   push to main and supports manual dispatch.
6. **Ticket the follow-up.** Open: a deep-investigation epic (every flagged
   date as a checkbox, subject-specific threads, porting the preservation
   pipeline), per-figure dossier tickets, and a project-chats ticket. Link the
   portal roadmap (cronologia.github.io issues).

Anti-traps: repos created non-empty get the wrong default branch; the Pages
environment does not follow later default-branch changes; branch deletion and
repo settings need the human — plan for it.
