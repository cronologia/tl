/**
 * i18n completeness — every translatable string reaches every locale.
 *
 * Why this test exists
 * --------------------
 * The localization walk matches EXACT strings, and the translator falls back
 * to the source string when a key is absent. That fallback is the right
 * runtime behaviour — a missing translation must never blank the page — but it
 * fails SILENTLY. Nothing goes red; the Spanish and Portuguese pages simply
 * carry English sentences, and review has no way to see it.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. In `olavo` a whole panel shipped with its headings
 * and twelve list items in the wrong language, and the defect was found by the
 * project owner looking at the rendered page. Fixing it surfaced three more of
 * the same kind, each invisible to every other check in the gate:
 *
 *   - prose hiding in a data field (`date: "undated in the corpus"`), where
 *     the field is correctly untranslated but the value was not a date;
 *   - a stale key, left behind when the English prose it translated was
 *     rewritten — so the translation sat unreachable while the new English
 *     rendered verbatim on both localized pages;
 *   - the project's own stance notes on each reference, which rode inside the
 *     `references` array and were skipped wholesale with the citation data.
 *
 * Both directions are checked, because each catches a different failure:
 *
 *   MISSING key  -> the localized page renders English.
 *   STALE key    -> a translation exists for text no longer in the dataset;
 *                   its live counterpart is almost certainly untranslated.
 *
 * The walk deliberately MIRRORS build.js's `localizeData` rather than
 * approximating it: the key sets are parsed out of build.js, and the
 * per-subtree allowlists and the array-inherits-the-parent-key rule are
 * reproduced exactly. A test that approximates the compiler is wrong in BOTH
 * directions — it passes while the page renders English, and it fails while the
 * page is right. Both have happened. In `olavo` the bibliography landed with
 * its own allowlist in build.js while this walk still had the old two-branch
 * version, so the suite demanded a Spanish translation for the Portuguese title
 * *O Jardim das Aflições*, which the compiler correctly leaves alone.
 *
 * So the mirror is not left to care: the last test in this file drives
 * `localizeData` itself with a marking dictionary and asserts it moved exactly
 * the strings the walk here selects.
 *
 * ADOPT points: the dataset filename, and the locales the repo publishes.
